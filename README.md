# Thylacine_Design

## Sequence analysis and primer design

## Types of analyses described here
### Pathogen sequence analysis
* Bacterial / viral pangenome analysis
* Genome wide BLASTn analysis using a reference genome 
* Identify regions within conserved genes with least diversity 
* Compare potential target conserved gene sequences to off-targets 

### Population structure analysis 
* Detecting population groups if not already known
* Detecting group defining mutations
	* Identifying regions that best differentiate populations
