# Pangenome analysis
**Purpose:** Prokaryotes and some DNA viruses have variable gene content and when designing a species level molecular test it is important to identify conserved genes. The concept of a pangenome, shown below, is the idea that individuals of a species share a common set of "core" genes, but may also have differing gene content in the "accessory" genome. The combined core and accessory genes make up the pangenome of a species.
